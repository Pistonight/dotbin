# dotbin
My python util scripts

## Installation
First clone the repo to a place like `~/dotbin`

Then run
### Bash
```bash
python ~/dotbin/_setup.py ~/.bashrc
```

### PowerShell (Windows only)
```powershell
python ~/dotbin/_setup.py $Profile
```

This will setup aliases for scripts in the `~/dotbin` directory.
For example `n` maps to `n.py`
